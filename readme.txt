With the Benchmark Email Lite plugin, you can quickly and easily place a signup form anywhere you want on your site. It’s also super simple to customize your forms.


== Installation ==

= Installing the plugin =

1. In your WordPress admin panel, go to Plugins > New Plugin, search for Benchmark Email Lite and click "Install now".
2. Alternatively, download the plugin and upload the contents of benchmark-email-lite.zip to your plugins directory, which usually is /wp-content/plugins/.
3. Activate the plugin.

= Initial setup =

1. If you are creating a new Benchmark Email account, [get a FREE account here](https://ui.benchmarkemail.com/register?p=68907 "get a FREE Benchmark Email account!").
2. In your WordPress admin panel, go to Benchmark > Settings.
3. Click "Connect to Benchmark".
4. Enter your Benchmark Email username and click "OK".
5. Enter your Benchmark Email password and click "OK".


== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Q1: Where do I go for help with any issues? =

Please call Benchmark Email at (800) 430-4095.

= Q2: What is an RSS email campaign? How to use? =

RSS campaigns send out a digest of blog posts on a schedule using your RSS feed URL. Further details can be found here: https://kb.benchmarkemail.com/how-do-i-create-an-rss-to-email-campaign/

Inside your WordPress Admin area, select Benchmark > Interface. Navigate to Emails > Create > RSS Email > Drag/Drop.

Enter your WordPress URL, which is your website followed by /feed. You may wish to filter the posts by category or tag, for example: https://codedcommerce.com/category/marketing-tips/feed. You may also use category IDs and filter nagatively to exclude a comma-separated list of them, for example: https://codedcommerce.com/?cat=-52047&feed=rss2

= Q3: Can I use Contact Form 7 (Gravity Forms, etc.) with this plugin? =

Yes. The plugin does not directly use any form frameworks other than native Benchmark Email signup forms. As with most WordPress projects, you can bridge the two together with custom code. We've assembled an example based on Contact Form 7. Install the [Code Snippets plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/code-snippets/), import the [sample code file](https://dev.codedcommerce.com/connect-contact-form-7-form-with-benchmark-email-contact-list.code-snippets.json), edit the code snippet to change the list ID mappings within the code and tailor the form field names to match your form (or visa-versa), then enable the code snippet and test.

= Q4: Can I programmatically filter the HTML email campaigns? =

Yes. In v3.3 we've added new hooks you can use in your custom functions. The new hooks are:

1. `add_filter( 'wpbme_post_title', function( $value, $post ) { return $value; }, 10, 2 );`
2. `add_filter( 'wpbme_post_content', function( $value, $post ) { return $value; }, 10, 2 );`
3. `add_filter( 'wpbme_email_type', function( $value, $post ) { return $value; }, 10, 2 );`
4. `add_filter( 'wpbme_email_html', function( $value, $post ) { return $value; }, 10, 2 );`

These filter the blog post title, the content body, the email type and generated HTML body. The email type is `DD` for the drop-down email editor and can be changed to `Custom` when doing raw HTML.
